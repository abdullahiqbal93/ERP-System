## Installation

### Prerequisites
- PHP 7.4 or higher
- MySQL 5.7 or higher
- Apache or Nginx server

### Steps to Set Up Locally

1. **Create the Database**
   - Open your MySQL client (e.g., phpMyAdmin) and create a new database, for example, `erp_system`.
   - Import the SQL schema file into this database to set up the necessary tables and relationships.

2. **Configure Database Connection**
   - Edit the `src/connection.php` file to set your database connection parameters:
     ```php
     <?php
     $host = 'localhost'; // Your database host
     $user = 'root'; // Your database username
     $password = ''; // Your database password
     $dbname = 'erp_system'; // Your database name

     $con = mysqli_connect($host, $user, $password, $dbname);

     if (!$con) {
         die("Connection failed: " . mysqli_connect_error());
     }
     ?>
     ```
  
2. **Paste the project folder into Server directory **
   - Place the project directory in your web serverâ€™s root directory. For Apache, this is usually `htdocs` (e.g., `C:\wampp\www` for WAMP).
  - Ensure that your web server is configured to serve PHP files and that the document root points to the `index.php` file of this project.
  - 
3. **Access the Application**
   - Start your web server and navigate to `http://localhost/erp-system/index.php` in your web browser to access the dashboard.

4. **Verify Dependencies**
   - Ensure you have an internet connection to load external resources like Bootstrap and Font Awesome.
   - There are no additional local dependencies required for this project.
